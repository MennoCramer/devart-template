## Description
Art for everyone is an exploration of value in for poeple in physical and digital sense. To receive a piece of art is a present, it will make you happy, it will connect you with others, it is intelectual to explore, to learn, to appreciate. This is a gift, something for every human in the world. To make something like this physically would be impossible and waste full. When you see a good piece of art this will lead to physical, psychological changes. It leaves a trace within a human body. When you do this with digital art, it is free. You can spread this endlessly, enjoy it repeatedly. 
Code is nescesary to make a unique piece fo art for all humans, (http://www.worldometers.info/) Everyone deserves a gift. 
Technology is needed to create as well as to show and spread.
